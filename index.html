          continued with CS courses, and by the time I wrote a rudimentary landmark-based "GPS" for freshmen navigating my high school, 
          I knew CS was what I wanted to pursue. While I have a particular excitement for machine learning (given the progress it's 
          seen in the past decades), I work hard to be up-to-date and proficient in other fields like web development, cloud computing

            Real-time American Sign Language (ASL) Recognition üßè
          </div>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Ever since I noticed the sign language alphabet on the last few pages of my student handbook sometime in fourth grade, 
            learning ASL has been a lifelong goal of mine. About a decade later, I've finally come back to learn it. In a <i>eureka</i>
            moment, I realized that I could develop two skills at once: ASL and ML. 
          </p>
          <p>
            ASL translation has been picking up speed over the past few years, but the technology is still underdeveloped compared to
            written/spoken language translation. Google has made perhaps the most significant progress, but given the fact that 
            ASL involves subtle and rapid finger movement, body movement, facial expressions, and its own rules of grammar, it's by no 
            means a closed problem. While I wouldn't claim to have the means to compete with a team of PhD-holding researchers at Google, I'm approaching the 
            problem nonetheless because I believe ASL translation deserves more research and hacking. 
          </p>
          <p>
            At the moment I'm using <a href="https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands#python-solution-api" target="blank">Google's MediaPipe</a>
            to perform the hand landmark detection, and at the moment I'm only training models on static, one-hand signs, like 24 of the 26 letters (J and Z require
            motion). I experimented with both a neural network and a support vector classifier, and while I expected the SVC to outperform the NN due to the way SVMs
            construct their decision boundaries, the SVC was actually more prone to confuse letters (e.g. E and O). That being said, I'll come back to 
            the SVC to determine if further optimization could improve the results.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next big step is to add a temporal aspect to the classification. This will be a huge shift, so I'll have to think very carefully about 
            the architecture. A key issue would be determining when one sign stops and the next begins; native signers transition seamlessly between signs, 
            much like we don't pause between words when we speak. So, I should look into how speech-to-text translation works for insight. I'll keep this page updated!

          <p>
            Metaschedule started as a frustration; namely, 
            a frustration with how difficult it was to plan courses at my college consortium. There already exists a tool 
            for course planning called <a href="https://hyperschedule.io" target="_blank">Hyperschedule</a>, but it requires
            users to specify which section of a course they wanted to take. For many students (myself included), knowing which
            sections to take to avoid conflicts <i>is</i> the problem, so Hyperschedule isn't particularly useful. If I had a 
            nickel for every time my course registration plan was torn asunder by courses filling up at the last moment, I would 
            have 20 cents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not enough to pay for laundry, but enough for me to make this scheduler tool that allows users to add courses they're
            interested in and explore the different non-conflicting permutations of those courses' sections, as well as provide 
            options for filtering specific sections and adding custom commitments. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The course data comes from an <a href="https://hyperschedule.herokuapp.com/api/v3/courses?school=hmc" target="_blank">
            API endpoint</a> provided by Hyperschedule, helpfully enough, so credit where credit is due :)
          </p>
          <p>
            Developing Metaschedule taught me a <i>lot</i> about web development (and equally as much about what I still have to learn)
            but, more importantly, it taught me that I can learn new and exciting skills by jumping in headfirst, asking around for help,
            and getting feedback on where to improve.

            I joined <a href="https://www.p-ai.org/" target="blank">P-ai</a> as a freshman, the year it was founded. Its vision was to become the incubator for all things machine
            learning at the consortium, and it's done exactly that. In my first year, I was accepted to a project team performing
            sentiment analysis on Tweets about #WeWork and I took on a second project in the spring to help a senior with his research
            on computationally lightweight facial recognition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coming into my freshman year, I had no experience with machine learning at all, which is why I spent a disproportionate
            amount of my time on these projects, reading technical articles, attending machine learning workshops after class, and
            working on side projects to get myself up to speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            After my first year, I was invited to join the leadership team. In a promising new organization with over 100
            members, joining the leadership has been both fast-paced and exciting, letting me take on a wide number of
            responsibilities like hosting ML workshops, helping organize a career panel, overseeing our project teams, and
            finding corporate partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most personally interesting to me, I got to lead a project team of my own in generating artificial jazz! Dubbed p-jazz
            (to match the theme), my team and I have been working on two different avenues of training models to replicate jazz piano
            from MIDI files: splitting music into chunks (phrases) and training an encoder-decoder model to "translate" from one phrase
            to the next, and finetuning GPT-2 to replicate the MIDI in text form.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project is still ongoing, but our GitHub is here. We've also had some preliminary results (music), but we're
            actively working on ideas for improvements, like training harmony and melody in tandem, and using transfer learning
            from classical music to jazz. In any case, ML + music is a dream come true for me.

            There actually isn't much to say for this one. Ampersand is a game I originally programmed on a school computer 
            in my free time during a high school sophomore year Java course. At one point in college I found myself with a 
            bit of free time again, so I figured, why not program it again, but on a nice frontend? And that's exactly what I 
            did. Sometimes you just want to code, what can I say?
